    "Various systems (hard disks, RAM, internet connections, mouse/keyboard, etc.) feed in **data** and **instructions** to the CPU for it to process, which it will then output back to one of the systems (internet, RAM, screen, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computer programs end up in an **assembly language** before being fed to the processor as instructions and data to apply the instructions on. It looks like this:\n",

    "If you somehow point the instructions to the wrong data, all sorts of weird thing can end up happening. For instance, old video games have famous *glitches* which descend from this fact:\n",
