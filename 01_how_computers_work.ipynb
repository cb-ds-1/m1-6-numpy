    "Let's learn how a computer works! Basically all computers when decomposed look like this:\n",

    "Various systems (hard disks, RAM, internet connections, mouse/keyboard, etc.) feed in **data** and **instructions** to the CPU for it to process, which it will then output back to one of the systems (internet, RAM, screen, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computer programs end up in an **assembly language** before being fed to the processor as instructions and data to apply the instructions on. It looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can even see this for ourselves! Some tools like https://godbolt.org/ help you see the assembly directly from code in \"native\" languages (programming languages like C, C++, Rust, D and Go that are compiled directly to computer assembly).\n",

    "### Binary Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see this if you try to open some computer files that are in a \"binary\" format in a text editor. The 1's and 0's try to get interpreted as text and you see garbage instead. for a computer, instructions are also data!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you somehow point the instructions to the wrong data, all sorts of weird thing can end up happening. For instance, old video games have famous *glitches* which descend from this fact:\n",

    "The first bit adds 0 or 1. The second adds 0 or 2, the third 0 or 4, etc. in powers of 2. Notice `1 + 2 = 3` so the first two bits cover all the numbers below the third bit. This is always true, so all numbers below $2^{n bits}$ are possible.\n",
